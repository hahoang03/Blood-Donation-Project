# REASON

## 1. Motivation
Blood donation is necessary for several circumstances, including organ transplants, accidents, cancer treatment, and more. In an emergency, it could be difficult to reach the right donor with the traditional way. To solve the problems related to blood donation process management, the Blood Donation management system has been developed.
Blood donation management system maintains all data related to blood donors, patients and blood banks. Finding blood donors will become easier with the help of the proposed program

## 2. Idea
The Blood Donation Management Project is a database management system designed to streamline and automate the processes involved in blood donation. The system aims to facilitate efficient management of blood donors, recipients, inventory, and various related activities within blood banks or organizations.

## 3. Special features

- The project provides a user-friendly interface that allows staff members to input, retrieve, and update information about blood donors, including their personal details, medical history, blood type, and contact information. Similarly, it enables managing recipient information, ensuring accurate matching of blood types for successful transfusions.
- Furthermore, the system keeps track of blood inventory levels, ensuring real-time monitoring of available blood units, expiration dates, and other relevant information. This feature contributes to minimizing wastage and optimizing utilization of blood resources.
- Additionally, the Blood Donation Management Project includes features like appointment scheduling, notification alerts for eligible donors, and tracking of blood donation history. These functionalities help in maintaining an active donor pool, encouraging regular donations, and enhancing overall organizational efficiency.
## 4. Goal

- Design the database to suit the requirements of Normalization BC Normal Form
- Connect the front-end interface (application) to the back-end database using a Java connection driver
- Develop the functions such as login, account creation, and booking; take a test using complex queries
-	Evaluate the data and give more precise predictions in the future for the users
-	Take security measures in the database to ensure robust privacy for the users' data and prevent any hacking into the system (known as SQL Injection)

Please see the [open issues](https://github.com/hahoang03/Blood-Donation-Project) for a full list of proposed features (
and known issues).
